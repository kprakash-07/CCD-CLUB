Count the Notebooks
You know that 
1
1 kg of pulp can be used to make 
1000
1000 pages and 
1
1 notebook consists of 
100
100 pages.

Suppose a notebook factory receives 
N
N kg of pulp, how many notebooks can be made from that?

Input Format
First line will contain 
T
T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single integer 
N
N - the weight of the pulp the factory has (in kgs).
Output Format
For each test case, output the number of notebooks that can be made using 
N
N kgs of pulp.
