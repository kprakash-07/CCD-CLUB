)
(1≤X<Y≤12).

Find the number of hours Chef works.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
T
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers 
X
X and 
Y
Y — the starting and ending time of working hours respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the number of hours Chef works.

The first line contains a single integer 
T
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains an integer 
N
N - denoting the number of friends.
Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of cars required to accommodate all the friends.
