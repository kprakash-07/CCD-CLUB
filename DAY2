You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yEs, yes, and yeS will all be treated as identical).

CODE:

t=int(input())
out=[]
for i in range(t):
    x=int(input())
    out.append(x)
for x in out:
    if(x<=30):
        print("NO")
    else:
        print("YES")
