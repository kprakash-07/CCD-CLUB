Mana Points

Chef is playing a mobile game. In the game, Chef's character Chefario can perform special attacks. However, one special attack costs 
XX mana points to Chefario.

If Chefario currently has 
YY mana points, determine the maximum number of special attacks he can perform.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer 
TT — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers 
XX and YY — the cost of one special attack and the number of mana points Chefario has initially.

Output Format

For each test case, output the maximum number of special attacks Chefario can perform.

Sample Input

3
10 30
6 41
50 2

OUTPUT:

3
6
0

CODE:

t=int(input())
out=[]
for i in range(t):
    x,y=map(int,input().split())
    out.append((x,y))
for x,y in out:
    if(x<=y):
        print(y//x)
    else:
        print("0")


Cyclic Quadrilateral:

Read problem statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
You are given the sizes of angles of a simple quadrilateral (in degrees) 
A
A, 
B
B, 
C
C and 
D
D, in some order along its perimeter. Determine whether the quadrilateral is cyclic.

Note: A quadrilateral is cyclic if and only if the sum of opposite angles is 
180
∘
180 
∘
 .

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer 
T
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of 
T
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers 
AA, BB, CC and DD.

Output

Print a single line containing the string "YES" if the given quadrilateral is cyclic or "NO" if it is not (without quotes).

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).
