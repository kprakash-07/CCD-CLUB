C rupees respectively and a Netflix subscription costs 
X
X rupees, find whether any two of them can contribute to buy a subscription.

The first line of input will contain a single integer 
T
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains four space-separated integers 
A
,
B
,
C
,
A,B,C, and 
X
X — the amount that Alice, Bob, and Charlie have, and the cost of a Netflix subscription respectively.
